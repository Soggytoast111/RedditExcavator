Premature thelarche has been reported in girls exposed to phthalates [365].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1hb26zz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskConservatives/comments/1hb26zz/if_new_regulations_from_the_fda_increases/m1e8bsq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1hb26zz/if_new_regulations_from_the_fda_increases/", "name": "t1_m1e8bsq", "author_flair_template_id": "bf189e12-c126-11e8-91e8-0e5613f63e1c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskConservatives", "author_flair_text": "Libertarian", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1733854652.0, "created_utc": 1733854652.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1hb26zz/if_new_regulations_from_the_fda_increases/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yb8u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "If new regulations from the FDA increases testosterone in men, but also causes people to become more violent, would that overall be a good thing or a bad thing?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskConservatives", "link_author": "SportNo2179", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "m1dtovf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SportNo2179", "num_comments": 40, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_m1di5kf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_i7l0m6ta", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Here is a clip](https://x.com/JBPpod/status/1665740841090965505?t=3684) where he talks about endocrine disruptors effect on development of children.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/JBPpod/status/1665740841090965505?t=3684\"&gt;Here is a clip&lt;/a&gt; where he talks about endocrine disruptors effect on development of children.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1hb26zz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskConservatives/comments/1hb26zz/if_new_regulations_from_the_fda_increases/m1dtovf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1hb26zz/if_new_regulations_from_the_fda_increases/", "name": "t1_m1dtovf", "author_flair_template_id": "bf189e12-c126-11e8-91e8-0e5613f63e1c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskConservatives", "author_flair_text": "Libertarian", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1733850079.0, "created_utc": 1733850079.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#349e48", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1hb26zz/if_new_regulations_from_the_fda_increases/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yb8u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Do you want the state to persecute liberals and leftists?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskConservatives", "link_author": "DataCassette", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "m1deceo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SportNo2179", "num_comments": 136, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t1_m1dbw8q", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_i7l0m6ta", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It depends on how the belief is applied.

If there's never a point where I'm losing - I can't interact with the mechanics. I have to be put in the situation where I unlock V-Trigger. If I'm never put in that situation, the game is boring.\n\nOkay, but that's not a realistic way that the round goes against competent opponents.  If you always crush your opponent into dust where they're never allowed to damage you, then of course the game is boring.  But not because you can't interact with game mechanics, it's because you are playing against a weak opponent.  \n\n&gt;Again, I have to actively lose to play the game properly.\n\nLosing health is part of playing.  And it is expected that you lose heath every round.  You don't have to do anything special to unlock V-Trigger.  You just have to play.  \n\nIf V-Trigger was gated behind some other condition that wasn't as guaranteed then yeah that would be bad.\n\n&gt;Any fighting game can be boiled down to this. Literally any of them. SF6 can seem less dynamic, but that's only because you actually have all of your tools from the beginning of the match.\n\nI'm making a very specific claim here.  In SFV there were multiple phases of the round.  There was the beginning where no one had meter, there was the V-Trigger activation phase where the opponent was looking for a way to activate and initiate their V-Trigger, and then there was active V-Trigger phase where you had to defend against it.  How you played during each one of those phases was entirely different.\n\nIn SF6 there is none of that.  You practically always have drive meter so every touch goes into the same drive rush cancel combo extension, into the same knockdown, into the same oki options.  And then they die and the round is over.   That's what I mean when I say the game feels less dynamic by comparison to SFV.  There's just less interesting stuff going on under the surface.  \n\n&gt;Your arguments almost come off as if you're a spectator to matches and not an actual player. SFV is great for watching, Brian_F's Oro? Idom's Laura? Punks Karin? Yeah, they're great to watch. With V-Trigger especially.\n\nWell not just watching, it was fun to strategize around these things too - both as BrianF/Punk/Idom, and as the players trying to defeat them.  Of course the balance on some of the characters/V-Triggers was not perfect and if SFV had more time to bake then some of that might have been worked out as well.  That's not to say that the mechanics were entirely bad though.  \n\n&gt;But as a game to play? SF6 has SFV beat by a million miles imo.\n\nI disagree with that.  I know that the devs said that simplifying the game mechanics to make it easier to pick up and play was a conscious decision that they made.  It does make the game more fun to play for people just starting out, but the way they went about that sacrificed a lot of the depth for higher level play.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You misunderstand. If there&amp;#39;s never a point where I&amp;#39;m losing - I can&amp;#39;t interact with the mechanics. I have to be put in the situation where I unlock V-Trigger. If I&amp;#39;m never put in that situation, the game is boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, but that&amp;#39;s not a realistic way that the round goes against competent opponents.  If you always crush your opponent into dust where they&amp;#39;re never allowed to damage you, then of course the game is boring.  But not because you can&amp;#39;t interact with game mechanics, it&amp;#39;s because you are playing against a weak opponent.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I have to actively lose to play the game properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Losing health is part of playing.  And it is expected that you lose heath every round.  You don&amp;#39;t have to do anything special to unlock V-Trigger.  You just have to play.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If V-Trigger was gated behind some other condition that wasn&amp;#39;t as guaranteed then yeah that would be bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any fighting game can be boiled down to this. Literally any of them. SF6 can seem less dynamic, but that&amp;#39;s only because you actually have all of your tools from the beginning of the match.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m making a very specific claim here.  In SFV there were multiple phases of the round.  There was the beginning where no one had meter, there was the V-Trigger activation phase where the opponent was looking for a way to activate and initiate their V-Trigger, and then there was active V-Trigger phase where you had to defend against it.  How you played during each one of those phases was entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In SF6 there is none of that.  You practically always have drive meter so every touch goes into the same drive rush cancel combo extension, into the same knockdown, into the same oki options.  And then they die and the round is over.   That&amp;#39;s what I mean when I say the game feels less dynamic by comparison to SFV.

I think the wheel does work out worse than other characters that can throw loop and shimmy, but it&amp;#39;s not &lt;em&gt;that bad&lt;/em&gt; if you are doing it right.  At the end of the day, if they OD DP and you covered that then they are still taking big damage, shimmy or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, just because dashing up sets up a throw loop doesn&amp;#39;t mean that she &lt;em&gt;has to dash&lt;/em&gt; on your wakeup.  She can also walk forward - and the options she gets off of that aren&amp;#39;t reactable in the same way that starting with a dash is.  So you can still get a shimmy that way if opponent respects your walk up approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1dj6k9c", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/StreetFighter/comments/1dj6k9c/am_i_making_too_much_a_deal_out_of_juri_not_being/l99hbpi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1dj6k9c/am_i_making_too_much_a_deal_out_of_juri_not_being/", "name": "t1_l99hbpi", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StreetFighter", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1718770771.0, "created_utc": 1718770771.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1dj6k9c/am_i_making_too_much_a_deal_out_of_juri_not_being/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnu5", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Please explain me why damage scaling is punishing you for choosing a longer route ?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "StreetFighter", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "l99fx33", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SportNo2179", "num_comments": 17, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1dj9xak", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_i7l0m6ta", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Performing combos in this game is pretty trivial.
