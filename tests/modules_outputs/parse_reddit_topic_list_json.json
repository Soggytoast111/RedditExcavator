I wasn\u2019t using it, and it seemed better than leaving it empty.\n\nAbout a year later, in 2023, I told them I wanted to sell the house and that they would need to move out. They said they were interested in buying it, so I offered to sell it to them for $125,000, with the condition that they would cover all fees and costs\u2014I simply wanted to net $125,000.\n\nOver the next year, they tried various ways to get financing, including applying for loans and trying to borrow money from a family member. I was even willing to finance part of the purchase myself if needed. By mid-2024, however, I wanted to sell the house so I could use the money elsewhere and eliminate the liability.\n\nAt that point, the house was uninsured. A storm or injury could have created major risk. When I tried to get insurance, I was told the roof was too old. FHA financing would also have required a new roof. My friend decided they would pay for a new roof and obtained a quote for $8,000, which seemed high to me. I suggested getting multiple quotes, since prices can vary widely, but they only obtained two. Since I wasn\u2019t paying for it, I left the decision up to them.\n\nThe roof had no leaks or damage\u2014it was simply old. A new roof would have been required for them to buy the house anyway, and I was confident I could sell the house as-is for $125,000, so I was not willing to pay for the roof myself.\n\nBy September 2024, the roof had been replaced, but they were still no closer to purchasing the house. In October 2024, I told them they would need to begin paying $250 per week in rent, which was roughly market rent. This was also intended to encourage progress, as every month of delay cost me money while costing them nothing.\n\nEven then, nothing changed. By September 2025\u2014nearly three years after they moved in\u2014I told them I was listing the house for sale and that this was their final opportunity to purchase it. They said they were trying to have a friend qualify for a loan, but eventually told me that person did not qualify due to credit card debt. I suggested paying down the debt, especially since they had already paid for a new roof, but nothing moved forward.\n\nI listed the house with a realtor for $145,000 in September 2025 because I was traveling and couldn\u2019t sell it myself. I informed my friend that, due to realtor fees, there was a strong chance there would be no additional money available to reimburse them for the roof. My goal remained netting $125,000.\n\nWithin 30 days, I received one cash offer. We settled at $130,000, and after fees, I netted approximately $121,000.\n\nAfter the sale, my friend sent me the roof invoice. The final cost was $12,000 due to additional wood replacement beyond the original $8,000 quote. While I understand that added costs can happen, the pricing seems high. They were charged $140 per sheet of plywood (seven sheets) and $96 per 1x6x12 board (ten boards). I recently received another roofing quote for a different property that listed plywood at $100 per sheet and $4 per linear foot for similar lumber.\n\nBecause of this, I believe they overpaid. If I had been managing the project, I would have verified that all replacements were necessary, reviewed individual material prices beforehand, and obtained more quotes.\n\nNow, my friend is asking what I intend to do regarding reimbursement for the roof. While I want to be fair, I also waited nearly three years for them to purchase the house and ultimately received less than my original target ($121,000 instead of $125,000), not including lost opportunity costs. I also incurred realtor fees that I would not have otherwise paid.\n\nGiven all of this, what is fair? What, if anything, should I give them for the roof?"}, {"topic_name": "Does faster thinking sometimes mean fewer internal checks?", "link_code": "t3_1pxxzc3", "self_code": "t3_1pxxzc3", "permalink": "/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1pxxzc3/does_faster_thinking_sometimes_mean_fewer/", "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1pxxzc3/does_faster_thinking_sometimes_mean_fewer/", "timestamp": 1766945238.0, "comment_count": 3, "author": "TripChirp-54", "summary": "We often treat speed of thought as a sign of cognitive strength, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s always true.

She wasn\u2019t my schoolteacher, but I took an extracurricular with her, and I saw her about once a week from when I was around 9 to when I was 18.\n\nIn a world where every adult woman I knew was married, likely had children, and was gossiped about when she didn\u2019t, this teacher of mine was in her fifties and unmarried and had been for as long as we\u2019d known her. More than that, she was and is extremely knowledgeable in her field and beyond, and she\u2019s tall and plus size and a bit masculine and so doesn\u2019t quite fit my hometown\u2019s beauty ideals. But she has a natural authority somehow that always put her above people\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder surely that I grew up looking up to her, when I was an awkward-looking and awkward-feeling teenager who slowly but surely realised I wasn\u2019t all that interested in men.\n\nI moved away after high school but I\u2019ve recently been back now and then to visit my family, and since it\u2019s a small town, I ran into her again a few times. She must be in her sixties now but she has a strange beauty to her and god she\u2019s just so *interesting.* I wondered a bit about her being perpetually single when I was an older teen, and you know the kind of things you imagine as a teenager\u2026 only now I\u2019m no longer a teenager and I still imagine things when I meet her.\n\nNow, obviously I\u2019m just going to go back to where I live now and I\u2019m probably never going to see her again.\n\nBut I just wondered, hypothetically: if I, like, asked her out now and she agreed - if you met a couple and they told you that this is how they met, would you think it\u2019s creepy or nopey or inappropriate somehow?\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think it is, since she never acted inappropriate in any way, she never did anything to influence me or my feelings, I was always going to grow up a lesbian and I was always going to end up the sort of person who\u2019d be interested in someone like her. I\u2019m an adult now who has agency over their own life, and it would be my own free decision based on my own desires if I were to approach her (which I won\u2019t).\n\nHOWEVER I do realise that if I met two people and they told me this is how they met, I would probably think it\u2019s a bit icky and worry about the younger individual\u2019s agency.\n\n**TL;DR: if you met a couple and found out one of them was the other\u2019s teacher since elementary school but they didn\u2019t get together until later and it was the younger one who made the first move, would you think it\u2019s creepy?**"}, {"topic_name": "If a child has an Indian father and a Filipino mother, grows up and lives in Dubai, and later gets citizenship in a Caribbean country through investment , where would their sense of identity most likely be rooted when they grow up?", "link_code": "t3_1pxx06m", "self_code": "t3_1pxx06m", "permalink": "/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1pxx06m/if_a_child_has_an_indian_father_and_a_filipino/", "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1pxx06m/if_a_child_has_an_indian_father_and_a_filipino/", "timestamp": 1766942986.0, "comment_count": 5, "author": "GrayRainfall", "summary": "Would they be Indian (even though they\u2019ve barely been to India)?
